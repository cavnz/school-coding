# Student Project Showcase

This folder contains all student submissions for the Juicy Platformer project.

## Folder Structure

Each project has its own numbered folder:

- `01-starter/` - Basic starting version (teacher demo)
- `02-super-juicy/` - Fully juiced version with all effects (teacher demo)
- `03-student-name/` - Student projects go here...

## Adding a New Project

1. Create a new folder with the next number (e.g., `03-johns-project`)
2. Add the three files:
   - `index.html` - The HTML structure
   - `style.css` - The styling
   - `game.js` - The game logic
3. Add a `README.md` describing what makes the project special
4. Update `../docs/showcase-data.js` to include the new project
